# Learning-Python
Here are some mini-projects/notes I made while learning Python.  
The actual learning occured in the folder helloWorld, the rest are mini-experiments/projects to test some things.  
The folder PythonCup houses my preperation and actual attempt at a tkinter focused competition, where I placed around the 96% mark (the minimum for successfully completing the challenge was atleast 90%.
