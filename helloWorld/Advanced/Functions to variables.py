# def hello():
#     print("Hello")

# hello()          # parenthesis () call the function, without them nothing happens
# print(hello)
# print(hi)

# hi = hello

# hello()
# hi()        #we are assigning the memory adress of the function hello() to the variable hi, so now we can call hello() by typing hi(), so two names basically

say = print      # print() -> this is a built-in function
say("Whoa! I can't believe this works! :O")
